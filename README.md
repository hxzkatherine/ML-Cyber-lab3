# ML-Cyber-lab3

The code is in the "ML_Lab3_XinzhuHan.ipynb" file, which is a notebook. You can simply run the notebook from the beginning. 

It has 5 parts: collect model and data, load data, load model, repair model and graph.

In this notebook, it shows the repaired networks and the accuracy for X={2%,4%,10%}. It also shows the plots of accuracy on clean test data and the attack success rate (on backdoored test data) as a function of the fraction of channels pruned.
